| Duration | 3 days |

## Description

### Overview 

The aim of this training is to cover the basic principles of fairness in healthcare modelling and highlight aspects of fairness that Health Data Scientists need to be aware of in their own research.

### Intended Learning Outcomes

- Participants will understand how bias can manifest itself in the different stages of predictive modelling in healthcare.
- Participants will understand the implications of biased samples, especially in the context of health data science such as genetic data or underreported medical conditions.
- Participants will have a broad understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic fairness within a given predictive model. 

### Teaching methods

The first part of the training will be largely based around discussions, but participants are expected to have read 4-5 of the key papers in this area that are listed below. In the second part, participants will be split into groups and work on a task. 

## Pre-requisites

Students will also need access to the [Nightingale](https://app.nightingalescience.org/projects) data. Nightingale is an open platform for health data but requires registration in advance and approval can take several days, so early registration is required. The platform contains lots of information on existing projects. Students are also advised to complete the MRC [“Research, GDPR and confidentiality”](https://byglearning.com/mrcrsc-lms/course/index.php?categoryid=1) e-learning module (or another equivalent training). 

For those who may be interested in finding out more about fairness in healthcare modelling, the MIT course [“Ethical Machine Learning in Human Deployments”](https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/14219) by Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi is excellent. 

**To do:**

1. Register for access to the [Nightingale](https://app.nightingalescience.org/projects) data.
2. Complete the MRC [“Research, GDPR and confidentiality”](https://byglearning.com/mrcrsc-lms/course/index.php?categoryid=1) e-learning module.
