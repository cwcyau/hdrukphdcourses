# Doctoral Immersion Weeks

This website provides information about [Health Data Research UK PhD Programme](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/careers-in-health-data-science/further-education/phd-programme/) (HDRUK) Immersion Week courses.

These courses were developed for our HDRUK PhD Programme but in the academic year 2022/23 we are expanding to allow a limited number of PhD students from outside the programme to participate in our courses with a view to expanding further in the future.

## Why should you be interested?

There are many reasons our courses are different to traditional approaches to PhD-level training:

- we are focused on advanced research topics not introductory data science,
- we enable interactivity, team work and discussion amongst participants,
- our HDRUK PhD cohorts are drawn from up to seven leading UK universities so you get to meet people from many different backgrounds,
- some of our costs are *free* (!)

## Do I need to do any work upfront?

Courses will typically require some pre-reading and, if access to health data is required, you may need to complete data registration and information governance training. You maybe asked to acquire some familiarity with R or Python if you have not encountered it before.

## How do you sign up?

To express your interest in a course, complete the following [Expression of Interest form](https://forms.gle/WVNmAMLzf1Rx9t4G9).

Places are limited and subject to availability so we will ask you to explain your interest in participating and use this to select participants if required.

## Who should apply?

Participants should be:

1. Current PhD students at a UK university,
2. Experienced in graduate-level studies in mathematics, statistics and computational science,
3. Proficient in a modern programming language (particularly Python and/or R).

## Course Timetable

In the academic year 2022/23, we will be running the following courses:
